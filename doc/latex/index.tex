 This is a C++ program to find time interval of the day with maximum number of visitors present in the museum.

Visiting times are given in a file in comma separated format. This filename needs to be passed into the program as a first argument. ~\newline
 {\itshape {\bfseries{Note}}} -\/ If no argument is passed, the program will run the unit test cases, see Unit Testing section

{\itshape {\bfseries{Compiler specifications}}} -\/ This code makes use of Catch2 unit testing framework which requires the code to be compiled using compiler supporting C++ 14 or more.

This program prints the interval in below format. ~\newline


start\+\_\+time-\/end\+\_\+time;number\+\_\+of\+\_\+visitors

{\bfseries{For example,}} If the file contains this\+: ~\newline
 10\+:15,14\+:20 ~\newline
 11\+:10,15\+:22 ~\newline
 09\+:58,11\+:14 ~\newline
 Then output will be ~\newline
 11\+:10-\/11\+:14;3 ~\newline
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Logic}{Logic}}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
It is assumed that time is represented in HH\+:MM format, ~\newline
 If there is any entry where time is not in HH\+:MM format, that particular entry is ignored (Corresponding info is logged on std\+:err). ~\newline
 Now, once we know that the time is in HH\+:MM format, therefore if we divide the whole day (24 hours) into minutes, ~\newline
 Then there will be 24\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}60 = 1440 distinct time points. ~\newline
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysubsection{\texorpdfstring{Populating frequency for each time point}{Populating frequency for each time point}}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
We have taken an array of 1440 elements where each element represents ~\newline
 a frequency of that time point appearing in any of the intervals from the input file. ~\newline
 We traverse the input file line by line -\/ on each line we get \mbox{[}start\+\_\+time, end\+\_\+time\mbox{]}. ~\newline
 For every point between start\+\_\+time and end\+\_\+time (both inclusive), ~\newline
 we increment the frequency for that point. ~\newline


{\bfseries{Space complexity\+:}} n entry and end points are store in a vector, so space complexity would be ~\newline
 n + 1440 elements for storing frequencies = O(n) ~\newline


{\bfseries{Time complexity\+:}} Being stored in contiguous memory (array), we can access each element in constant time with its index. ~\newline
 Each element can be increased at max n times, we will need 1440\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}n operations ~\newline
 (considering hypothetical case where all visitors entered and exited at same time) ~\newline
 Also n insertions in a vector to store the entry and exit pairs ~\newline
 Hence the value would be 1440\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}n + n = O(n) ~\newline

Using array to store frequencies of the time points makes sure that all the time points are stored in ascending order. ~\newline
 To find the interval which contains maximum number of visitors, ~\newline
 we iterate over each element of the array and find a group of adjacent elements ~\newline
 with same value (same frequency). Out of all such groups we take the one with maximum value. ~\newline
 say (start, end, frequency). ~\newline


If there is more than one such group, then we will consider the group where ~\newline
 difference between last and first element is largest. ~\newline
 This way we guarantee that always largest interval with maximum visitors is found. ~\newline


{\bfseries{Time complexity\+:}} K\texorpdfstring{$\ast$}{*}1440 comparisons + at max 1440 comparisons in find\+\_\+if applied on frequencies ~\newline
 = O(1) ~\newline
 {\itshape {\bfseries{Note}}} -\/ Here is K \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} 0 is some constant representing no of comparisons per iteration, see \doxylink{class_time_intervals_a48338b49b7f47af7b576607555271c81}{Time\+Intervals\+::find\+Max\+Interval\+And\+Count} for more details ~\newline

consider below input file ~\newline
 input file\+: ~\newline
 09\+:58,11\+:14 ~\newline
 10\+:15,11\+:10 ~\newline
 11\+:12,15\+:22 ~\newline
 11\+:19,12\+:15 ~\newline


Here, ~\newline
 \mbox{[}10\+:15,11\+:10\mbox{]} is common between first and second entry ~\newline
 Hence its frequency is 2 ~\newline
 \mbox{[}11\+:19,12\+:15\mbox{]} is common between third and forth entry ~\newline
 Hence its frequency is 2 ~\newline
 But length of \mbox{[}11\+:19,12\+:15\mbox{]} = 56 \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} length of \mbox{[}10\+:15,11\+:10\mbox{]} ~\newline
 Hence our program will output 11\+:19-\/12\+:15;2 ~\newline
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Unit testing}{Unit testing}}\label{index_autotoc_md5}
We have used Catch2 -\/ a header only unit testing framework to write the test cases. ~\newline
 The header file catch.\+hpp is included in the src directory solely to able to write unit test cases using the Catch2 framework. ~\newline
 When the main program is executed without any arguments it will run all the unit test cases and provide the output on std\+::out console. ~\newline
 All unit tests are written in \doxylink{_unit_tests_8cpp}{Unit\+Tests.\+cpp} file.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{Data validation\+:}{Data validation\+:}}\label{index_autotoc_md6}
The program will print on standard error the warning about invalid entry and exit times -\/ ~\newline
 if they are not in HH\+:MM format or if entry time \texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} exit time ~\newline
